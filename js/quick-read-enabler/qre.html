<h3>Sample Text</h3>

<div id="input_text">
Part of our nature as humans is to develop belief systems that become handy
ways for seeing and understanding the world around us and for ordering our
reality. We can refer to these mechanisms as institutional logics.1 Institutional
logics become normative and play a key role in guiding and determining our
behavior. Many of these institutional logics arise from our training and education
and thus the ordered view of the world from the perspective of an economist
is different from that of an accountant, mechanic, sociologist, physicist, fire
fighter, or moral philosopher. Regardless, they enable viewing a complex world
in what promises to be coherent terms and provide a lens for perceptually
separating noise from signal. Thus, they contribute to comfort, understanding,
and sense-making.
